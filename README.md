## Contribute

### Tech stack

- Rust
- Hyl√© supports [several proving schemes](https://docs.hyle.eu/concepts/proof-generation/#our-supported-proving-schemes): choose your favorite. For some issues, we will add a recommendation on which proving scheme to use; for most issues, you can build with whichever stack you're more comfortable with.

### Apply

Register [on OnlyDust](https://app.onlydust.com/) to get rewarded for your contributions. *Do not apply to issues on GitHub: apply [on the OnlyDust platform](https://app.onlydust.com/).*

PRs submitted without prior assignment will NOT be accepted.

#### First-time contributor

If this is your first contribution to our project:

- Introduce yourself very briefly. Keep in mind that we can see your OnlyDust profile: no need to rehash your entire resume!
- Describe how you plan to address the issue. You don't need to be extremely specific, we just want to be sure you know where you're going.
- Join [our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org).

If we notice that your application is AI-generated, we'll assume that you won't use your brain to think about the issue. That's not a good sign. We don't want a perfect application, but we want an honest one, so please keep it human. (You can obviously use any tools you want for development itself.)

#### Returning contributor

- Comment on the issue through OnlyDust to indicate that you are available and interested.
